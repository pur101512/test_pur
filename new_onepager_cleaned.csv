Difficult, so I said that I would have to seek a better rate elsewhere. The person then proceeded to tell me it had to be completed in seven days, I think, and that landed on a Sunday. The person gave up at this point and I hung up confused and disappointed at the was, as a client was treated. The person was not rude, but the conversation was difficult. I then phoned back, maybe next day, to have the term deposit terminated and the funds transferred to the ANZ bank, and I asked, again, if there was a better rate. There was, and I have reinvested with AMP for twelve months at 4.5%. But this was hard work on my behalf to achieve a result. I was extremely disappointed to say the least.

Instead of processing the withdrawal as per my instructions, they have transferred the money to a Personal Super Account which was newly created.  Upon noticing this I called the Team again  on Tuesday, 2nd June 2025 and I spoke to Carolyn from Customer Service Team who looked into my case and noticed the error in processing and escalated the matter and got my money transferred as per my request the following day.  Carolyn also raised a complaint (Ref.6077090898).  This delay in processing caused me a to pay a higher interest in my home loan account.

I didn't have to change anything. .Another letter  2nd July 2025 about not being able to ""contact via email"".  This is what the complaint was about . Contact details  in account info are correct, so where is the TPG info from. The complaint was ""why AMP was not using the account contact details information and in correspondence by letter detailing there was another email address being referred to. Furthermore the email response about the complaint,  ""Your complaint  You're dissatisfied with your experience with AMP Bank, while updating your email address, your lack of confidence in AMP Bankâs Information Technology systems to keep your data accurate, and about our identification process.
