Instead of processing the withdrawal as per my instructions, they have transferred the money to a Personal Super Account which was newly created. Upon noticing this I called the Team again on Tuesday, 2nd June 2025 and I spoke to Carolyn from Customer Service Team who looked into my case and noticed the error in processing and escalated the matter and got my money transferred as per my request the following day. Carolyn also raised a complaint (Ref.6077090898). This delay in processing caused me a to pay a higher interest in my home loan account. I like to mention it is not Anna who attended to me. It was Carolyn from Customer Service who noticed the error in processing and fixed the whole situation in one day and enabled the funds to be in my account the next day. I would really appreciate Carolyn's professsionalism and great customer service skills. She handled the matter very well and understanding my situation and the what it meant to me and the cost of the delay in processing the transfer.
